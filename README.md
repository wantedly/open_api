  info: OpenApi::Info.new(
    title: "Awesome API",
    description: "It provides something awesome",
    version: "1.0.0",
  ),
  paths: OpenApi::Paths.new(
    "/pets": OpenApi::PathItem.new(
      get: OpenApi::Operation.new(
        description: "Returns all pets from the system that the user has access to",
        responses: OpenApi::Responses.new(
          "200": OpenApi::Response.new(
            description: "A list of pets.",
            content: {
              "application/json": OpenApi::MediaType.new(
                schema: OpenApi::Schema.new(
                  type: "array",
                  items: OpenApi::Reference.new(ref: "#/components/schemas/pet"),
                )
              )
            }
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
)

yaml = OpenApi::Serializers::YamlSerializer.serialize(spec)
File.write("spec.yml", yaml)
```

### Deserializing

```rb
yaml = File.read("spec.yml")
spec = OpenApi::Serializers::YamlSerializer.deserialize(yaml)
```
